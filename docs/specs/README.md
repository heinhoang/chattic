# Chattic App
 Chattic is a Real time instant messaging application which provides functionality of real time delivery of messages and multimedia between two users.

## Designed Features
Chattic, at its core, is a messaging service built for webapp, relying on internet connection. Cheaper than service provided SMS services, most of features in Chatty are provided for free. Take a good look at salient features:

* **Instant Messaging:** This is the basis of your app’s success, and a basic feature of all chat apps. It operates largely through a user’s connection to the internet, and even when they *go offline*, users are able to receive all the notifications they missed when they go back online. Because all chat apps will host this instant messaging feature, it’s the little additions that count here: the ability to have *private or public chats*, for instance.

* **Multimedia File Transmission:** Users of you chat app are going to love the ability to share various types of multimedia, such as pictures, videos, files, GIFS, and stickers.

**Group Chats:** Your chat app should further allow users to connect with other users through the facilitation of group conversations, where they can also share multimedia files.

## Technologies Consideration
The two main types of connections used in chat apps are HTTP + Push Notifications and Extensive Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) protocols. HTTP + Push Notifications are used more for file sharing apps like Instagram, whereby when you leave a comment the user receives a push-notification, and when the app is reopened it then connects to the app’s server, but it’s a good idea to have a push notifications default built into your app so users are able to receive notifications of new messages.

### Potential technologies

**NodeJS:** Fast, lightwight programming language. We can use *ExpressJS*, *SocketIO* to build a chat app.
**MongoDB:** This is the database that will allow you to store messages, files, images, documents, and the rest of the multimedia files that will be running through your app.

## Development and Cost
The approximate starting costs for Chat App development is can range from anywhere between $30,000 to $55,000, to up to $120,000. These costs are dependent on your team’s hourly rates.

The process of building the app itself can take up to 1400 hours by a team of experienced developers (integrating a messaging functionality can take up to 150 man hours on its own, and multimedia transmission taking a bare minimum of 100 hours, for example).

## Conclusion
These are some of the specifics you’ll need to develop a Chat App.
From the bottom up, the process may seem complicated, especially if you lack the high tech skill required to architect, develop, and maintain your app on front end platforms. You’ll want a team that explores all possibilities, and leaves no stone unturned for your business and development needs; a team that helps to investigates all your business needs and future aspirations to enable your app to bloom into its fullest potential.
